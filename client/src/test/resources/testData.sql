As you know she is a pleasant 54-year-old female who has multiple medical problems and is seeking evaluation for laparoscopic gastric banding.  I saw her on October 3, 2008 in the office after she had attended a Fairfield County Bariatrics and Surgical Specialists seminar.  She is 57in; tall and weighs 242 pounds.  She has been overweight since age 27.  She is now at her highest adult weight.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her medical conditions driving her toward surgery include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, varicose veins, prior history of stroke.  She denies any history of cancer.  She does have a history of hepatitis which I will need to further investigate.  She complains of multiple joint pains, and heavy snoring.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes hysterectomy in 1995 for fibroids and varicose vein removal.  She had one ovary removed at the time of the hysterectomy as well.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a single mother of one adopted child.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is a strong family history of heart disease and hypertension, as well as diabetes on both sides of her family.  Her mother is alive.  Her father was an alcoholic and is deceased.  She has five siblings.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  As you know she takes the following medications for her diabetes, insulin 70 units/6 units times four years, aspirin 81 mg a day, Actos 15 mg, Crestor 10 mg and CellCept 500 mg two times a day.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a 54-year-old obese female.  She does not appear to have any significant residual deficits from her stroke.  There may be slight left arm weakness.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  We will have her undergo routine nutritional and psychosocial assessment. Alcohol abuse screening will be perfromed. I suspect that we can significantly improve the situation with her insulin and oral hypoglycemia, as well as hypertension, with significant weight loss.  She is otherwise at increased risk for future complications given her history, and weight loss will be a good option.  We will see her back in the office once she completes her preliminary workup and submit her for approval to the insurance company.\n'),(10,'1122-Acute Kidney Failure 2','Past','Acute Kidney Failure  \nDescription:  Patient with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stage III CKD.\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Acute kidney failure.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old Korean gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and stage III CKD with a creatinine of 1.8 in May 2006 corresponding with the GFR of 40-41 mL/min.  The patient had blood work done at Dr. XYZs office on June 01, 2006, which revealed an elevation in his creatinine up to 2.3.  He was asked to come in to see a nephrologist for further evaluation.  I am therefore asked by Dr. XYZ to see this patient in consultation for evaluation of acute on chronic kidney failure.  The patient states that he was actually taking up to 12 to 13 pills of Chinese herbs and dietary supplements for the past year.  He only stopped about two or three weeks ago.  He also states that TriCor was added about one or two months ago but he is not sure of the date.  He has not had an ultrasound but has been diagnosed with prostatic hypertrophy by his primary care doctor and placed on Flomax.  He states that his urinary dribbling and weak stream had not improved since doing this.  For the past couple of weeks, he has had dizziness in the morning.  This is then associated with low glucose.  However the patients blood glucose this morning was 123 and he still was dizzy.  This was worse on standing.  He states that he has been checking his blood pressure regularly at home because he has felt so bad and that he has gotten under 100/60 on several occasions.  His pulses remained in the 60s.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Imdur 20 mg two to three times daily, nitroglycerin p.r.n., insulin 70/30 40/45 units daily, Zetia 10 mg daily, ?

No drug abuse.  He quit tobacco and alcohol 15 years ago.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Parents both died in Korea.  Has one sister with hypertension and the other sister lives in Detroit and is healthy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He has lost about 10 pounds over the past month.  He has been fatigue and weak with no appetite.  He has occasional chest pain and dyspnea on exertion on fast walking.  His lower extremity edema has improved with higher doses of furosemide.  He does complain of some early satiety.  He complains of urinary frequency, nocturia, weak stream and dribbling.  He has never passed the stone.  He gets dizzy when his blood sugars are in the 40s to 60s but now this is continuing with him running, glucose is in the 120s.  He has some right back pain today and complains of farsightedness.  The remainder of review of systems is done and negative per the patient.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 78.  Blood pressure 116/60.  Height 57&quot; per the patient.  Weight 78.6 kg.  Supine pulse 60 with blood pressure 128/55.  Standing pulse 60 with blood pressure of 132/50.  GENERAL:  He is in no apparent distress, but he is dizzy on standing for prolonged period.  Eyes:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Sclerae not icteric.  HEENT:  He wears upper and lower dentures.  Lips acyanotic.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Oropharynx is otherwise clear.  NECK:  Supple.  No JVD.  No bruits.  No masses.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Active bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No suprapubic tenderness.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  5/5 strength bilaterally.  No synovitis, arthritis or gait disturbance.  SKIN:  Old scars in his low back as well as his left lower extremity.  No active rashes, purpura or petechiae.  Midline sternotomy scar is well healed.  NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Reflexes are poor to 1+ bilaterally.  10 g monofilament sensation is intact except for the big toes bilaterally.  No asterixis.  Finger-to-nose testing is intact.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Fully alert and oriented.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  December 2004, creatinine was 1.5.  Per report May 2006, creatinine was 1.8 with a BUN of 28.  Labs dated 06/01/06, hematocrit was 32.3, white blood cell count 7.2, platelets 263,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, CO2 25, BUN 46, creatinine 2.3, glucose 162, albumin 4.7, LFTs are normal.  CK was elevated at 653.  A1c is 7.6%.  LDL cholesterol is 68, HDL is 35.  Urinalysis reveals microalbumin to creatinine ratio 59.8.  UA was otherwise negative with a pH of 5.  Today his urinalysis showed specific gravity 1.020, negative glucose, bilirubin, ketones and blood, 30 mg/dL of protein, pH of 5, negative nitrates, leukocyte esterase.  Microscopic exam was bland.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Acute on chronic kidney failure.  He has underlying stage III CKD with the GFR approximately 41 mL/min.  He has episodic hypotension at home and low diastolic pressure here.  His weight is down 2 to 3 Kg from June and he may be prerenal.  He also has a history of prostatic hypertrophy and obstruction must be investigated.  I am also concerned about his use of Chinese herbs which can cause chronic interstitial nephritis.  There is no evidence of pyuria today although this can present with a fairly bland sediment.  An additional concern is that TriCor can cause an artifactual increase in the creatinine due to changes in metabolism.  I think this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.\n2.  Orthostatic hypotension.  He is maintaining systolic but his diastolic pressures are gotten in to a point where he may not be perfusing his brain well.\n3.  Elevated creatine kinase consistent with myositis.  It could be a result of Crestor alone or combination of TriCor and Crestor.  I do not think this is enough to cause rhabdomyolysis, however.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  The patient was cautioned about using NSAIDs and told to avoid any further Chinese herbs.\n2.  Recheck labs including CBC with differential, SPEP, uric acid and renal panel.\n3.  Decrease atenolol to 25 mg daily.\n4.  Decrease enalapril to 10 mg daily.\n5.  Decrease Lasix to 20 mg daily.\n6.  Stop Crestor.\n7.  Check renal ultrasound.\n8.  See him back in two weeks for review of the studies.\n'),(11,'1165-Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation 2','Current','Sample Name: Comprehensive Neurological Evaluation  Description:  A woman presents for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nThank you very much for asking me to see this very interesting and pleasant woman for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.  She is present in the company of her husband.\n\nAs you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant.\n\nHer neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk.  She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall.  She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests.  She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made.\n\nThe slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved.  She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking.\n\nIn about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia.  She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing.  She was diagnosed as having &quot;overactive bladder&quot;, but the cause of this was never determined.  She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit.  She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it.\n\nAlso in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable &quot;stiffness&quot; in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles.  Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others.  She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was &quot;not arthritis, but no definite diagnosis was ever established.  She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal.  No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms.\n\nHowever, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat.  She states from time-to-time she could barely walk.  She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were walking on stilts.  She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit.  She began to tire more easily when walking.\n\nIn 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X.  He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine.  He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing.  After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis.  However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003.  Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex.  She continued on it for about six months.  However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it.  She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy.  So, she discontinued it also.\n\nAt that point in time, she decided to try a program of &quot;good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil.\n\nIn December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities.  She began to have to use a cane.  She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z.  She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak.  Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically.  However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline.\n\nShe was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005).  This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial.  However, it wore off once again.\n\nA repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to look better.  She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit.\n\nFinally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets.  She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs.  She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity.\n\nShe has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents.\n\nThe patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability.  There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Essentially noncontributory.\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN.  She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She takes one glass of wine per day.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has not had any prior surgeries.  Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems.\n\nREVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES:  The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet.  There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum.  There appear to be Dawsons fingers.  The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities.\n\nAlso available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05.  The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions.\n\nHowever, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal.  Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord.  It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital signs:  Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5&ordm;F, and weight 124 lb (dressed).\nGeneral:  Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.\nHead:  Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits.\nNeck:  Supple, with full range of motion.  No spasm or tenderness.  Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits.  No thyromegaly or adenopathy.\nExtremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity.  Range of motion full throughout.\n\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:\nMental Status:  Awake, alert, oriented to time, place, and person; appropriate.  Recent and remote memory intact.  No evidence of right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia.\n\nCRANIAL NERVES:\nII:  Visual fields full to confrontation.  Fundi benign.\nIII, IV, VI:  Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus.  No ptosis.  Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation.\nV:  Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally.  Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally.  Motor function normal.\nVII:  No facial asymmetry.\nVIII:  Hears finger rub bilaterally.  Weber and Rinne tests normal.\nIX & X:  Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation.  Gag reflex equal bilaterally.\nXI:  Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally.\nXII:  Tongue midline without atrophy or fasciculations.  Rapid alternating movements normal.  No dysarthria.\n\nMotor:  Tone, bulk, and strength are normal in both upper extremities.  In the lower extremities, there is moderate spasticity on the right and moderately severe spasticity on the left.  There are bilateral Achilles contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture.\n\nStrength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left):  Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5.  There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements.\n\nReflexes (right/left):  Biceps 3/3, triceps 3/3, brachioradialis 3/3, knee jerk 4/4, and ankle jerk 4/0.  Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally.  No pathological reflexes.\n\nCoordination:  Finger-nose-finger testing and rapid alternating movements appear to be normal in both upper extremities.  The lower extremities could not be adequately tested because of spasticity and weakness.\n\nGait:  The patient has a spastic and slightly broad based gait.  She is able to walk without support.  After walking for a period of time, she is finally able to get her left foot down flat, but tends to walk on the left toes.\n\nStation:  Romberg testing with the eyes open is normal.  With the eyes closed, there is slight unsteadiness and she actually fell on one occasion, but was able to catch herself.\n\nSensation:  Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout.  Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  Multiple sclerosis, ? secondary progressive versus relapsing/remitting.\n\nCASE DISCUSSION:  Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting lady.  Based on review of her history and her current MRI scans, she seems to suffer from multiple sclerosis.  She indicated that there was a slow progression of her disease from December 2004 to February 2005 and perhaps beyond that.  She also indicated that she has some improvement with oral steroids and to a lesser extent with IV steroids.  However, she keeps slipping back.  Overall however, she thinks that she is better now than she was several months ago suggesting that this may have been a slow exacerbation rather than actual progression of her MS.\n\nAt this point in time, she appears to be confusing symptom treatment with treatment of her multiple sclerosis.  Steroids can relieve spasticity in selected patients.  However, they are not good long-term choices because of the obvious side effects that we see with long-term use of steroids.  So, although she has benefit from the current prednisone dosage, I feel it would be more appropriate to try and find something else to help her with her spasticity.  She is unable to tolerate Zanaflex and baclofen because of sedation.\n\nI have recommended a trial of Neurontin beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and gradually increasing as needed up to 300 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d.  Additional increases may be necessary depending on how she does with these lower doses.  Some patients may take as high as 1000-1500 mg three to four times daily.  If the Neurontin cannot be tolerated or it does not bring about any relief of her spasticity, I would consider Klonopin 0.25 mg-1 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. or Valium 5-10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.  If these are not helpful or if there are intolerable side effects, she should be considered for baclofen pump.\n\nI spent a lot of time discussing with her baclofen pump, as she was unfamiliar with it, although she has initially and understandably opposed to this treatment, she may well require this treatment in the future in order to allow her to ambulate adequately.  With the baclofen pump in place, the patient should have good relief of spasticity and be able to exercise her legs strongly.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether she is actually having secondary progressive MS or relapsing/remitting MS.  I feel it would be appropriate to start her on immunomodulatory therapy.  Since interferon made her spasticity worse, I would recommend a trial of Copaxone.\n\nI would also obtain an annual MRI scan of the brain; however, this should be accomplished with a high-field strength magnet (1.5-Tesla or greater).\n\nIf she has worsening of her clinical condition or should her MRI show continued worsening, I would recommend consideration of adding methotrexate or CellCept to her regimen.  She may also be a candidate for Tysabri if it returns to the market place in the next few months.\n\nShe is currently not much troubled by her bladder symptoms and so I do not think she needs any particular treatment for this problem currently.  However, should her symptoms worsen in the future, urological consultation by a physician familiar with neurogenic bladder would be helpful.\n\nFinally, I feel that she will benefit from some physical therapy.  I have recommended physical therapy evaluation and treatment three times weekly for six weeks.\n\nThe patient currently has HMO insurance and I recommended that she followup here on an as needed basis.  She should followup with you for her regularly scheduled medical appointments.\n\nThe patient indicates that she may be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the near future and I gave her the names of two MS physicians in Dallas, which is apparently only about a two-hour ride away.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions about her case.\n'),(12,'1186-Consult - Atrial Fibrillation 2','NonDrinker','Sample Name: Consult - Atrial Fibrillation  Description:  Patient with past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post bypass grafting surgery and history of a stroke with residual left sided hemiplegia.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Atrial fibrillation.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old, Hispanic woman with past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post bypass grafting surgery and history of a stroke with residual left sided hemiplegia.

Liver function tests are within normal limits.  INR was 1.1.\n\nA 2D echo was performed on August 11, 2009, and revealed left ventricle normal in size with EF of 50%.  Mild apical hypokinesis.  Mild dilated left atrium.  Mild aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.  No intracardiac masses or thrombus were noted.  The aortic root was normal in size.\n\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  It is unknown if this is a new onset versus a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Given the patient has a recurrent stroke, anticoagulation with Coumadin to prevent further stroke is indicated.  However, given the patients current neurologic status, the safety of falling is unclear.  We need to further discuss with the patients primary care physician, probably rehab physician.  If the patients risk of falling is low, then Coumadin is indicated.  However, if the patients risk for falling is high, then a course using aspirin and Plavix will be recommended.  Transesophageal echocardiogram probably will delineate possible intracardiac thrombus better, however will not change our current management.  Therefore, I will not recommend transesophageal echocardiogram at this point.  Currently, the patients heart rate is well controlled, antiarrhythmic agent is not recommended at this point.\n2.  Carotid artery stenosis.  The patient underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound on this admission and found to have a high-grade increased velocity of the right internal carotid artery.  It is difficult to assess the severity of the stenosis given the history of possible right carotid stenting.  If clinically indicated, CT angio of the carotid will be indicated to assess for stent patency.  However, given the patients current acute stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time.\n3.  Coronary artery disease.  Clinically stable.  No further test is indicated at this time.\n'),(13,'1190-Neurologic Consultation - 3','Past','Sample Name: Neurologic Consultation - 2  Description:  Patient has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nREASON FOR VISIT:  The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.\n\nAccording to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.\n\nIn regard to the bladder, he states, &quot;I wet the bed.&quot;  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patients urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.\n\nHe has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.\n\nIn regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.\n\nHe has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinsons disease or Alzheimers disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.\n\nPast medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinsons disease.  His mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes.\n\nHe does not have a Living Will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself.\n\nREVIEW OF HYDROCEPHALUS RISK FACTORS:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg three times a day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, lisinopril 20 mg per day, metoprolol 50 mg per day, Uroxatral 10 mg per day, Detrol LA 4 mg per day, and aspirin 81 mg per day.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  On examination today, this is a pleasant 76-year-old man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.\n\nVital Signs:  His weight is 180 pounds.\n\nHead:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The head circumference is 59 cm, which is the \n75-90th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm.\n\nSpine:  The spine is straight and not tender.  I can easily palpate the spinous processes.  There is no scoliosis.\n\nSkin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.\n\nCardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.\n\nMental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.\n\nCranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.\n\nMotor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.\n\nSensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.  Either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing.\n\nCerebellar Exam:  Is intact for finger-to-nose, heel-to-knee, and rapid alternating movement tests.  There is no dysarthria.\n\nReflexes:  Trace in the arms, 2+ at the knees, and 0 at the ankles.  It is not certain whether there is a Babinski sign or simply withdrawal.\n\nGait:  Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 7-10/16 and a gait score of 2-5/12 for a total score of 9-15/28, which is significantly impaired.\n\nREVIEW OF X-RAYS:  I personally reviewed the MRI scan of the brain from December 11, 2007 at Advanced Radiology.  It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.\n\nASSESSMENT:  The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  His examination today is notable for moderate-to-severe dementia and moderate-to-severe gait impairment.  His MRI scan raises the question of hydrocephalus, however, is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease.\n\nPROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).\n2.  Probable cerebral small-vessel disease (290.40 & 438).\n3.  Gait impairment (781.2).\n4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence (788.33).\n5.  Dementia.\n6.  Hypertension.\n7.  Hypercholesterolemia.\n8.  Diabetes.\n\nPLAN:  I had a long conversation with him and his family.  I explained how the symptoms raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific.  I also explained how the appearance of the ventricles on the MRI scan raise the question of hydrocephalus, but are not specific for.  I also described the evidence on the MRI scan of the long-term effects of his vascular risk factors and explained to his family that these can cause a clinical syndrome that is virtually identical to hydrocephalus.  I explained that it is possible for patients to have both and the best way to determine whether he has hydrocephalus, and more specifically whether he would benefit from shunt surgery is to undertake a test with temporary removal of spinal fluid.  I reviewed both our outpatient lumbar puncture approach and our inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  I gave them a printed description of the inpatient spinal catheter protocol.  His daughter tape-recorded our discussions, so that they can review this.\n\nWe did review the specific risk of 2% to 3% chance of infection associated with the spinal catheter protocol.  I told them that this is not an emergency and they can take the time to review the details and to contact our office if they have any questions, or if they would like to proceed with testing.\n'),(14,'1293-Pseudoseizures 3','Unknown','Sample Name: Pseudoseizures  Description:  The patient was referred due to a recent admission for pseudoseizures.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nREASON FOR REFERRAL:  The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of the Hospitalist Service at Childrens Hospital due to a recent admission for pseudoseizures.  This was a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/19/2007 with the patients mother.  I have reviewed with her the boundaries of confidentiality and the treatment consent form, and she stated that she had understood these concepts.\n\nPRESENTING PROBLEM:  It is reported that the patient was recently hospitalized and has been hospitalized in 2 occasions for pseudoseizure activity.  These were confirmed by video EEG and consist of trembling, shaking, and things of that nature.  She does have a history of focal seizures and perhaps simple seizures, which were diagnosed when she was 5 years old, but the seizure activity that was documented during the hospital stay is of a significant different quality.  I had met with them in the hospital and introduced myself and gathered some basic background information, but this is a supplement to that information, which is contained within this chart.  It was reported to me that she has been under considerable stress.  First of all, it should be noted that the patient is developmentally delayed.  Although she is 17 years old, she operates at about a fourth grade level.  Mother reported that The patient becomes stressed because she thinks that everyone is against her, that she cannot do anything unless someone is there, that she needs a lot of direction, that she gets confused easily, that she thinks that people become angry at her, that she misinterprets what people are saying and thinks that they are upset.  It is reported, the patient feels that her mother yells at her, and that is mad at her often.  It was reported that in addition she recently has had change in her visitation with her father, that she within the last 6 months, has started seeing her father every other weekend after he had been discharged from prison.  She reported that what is stress for her is that sometimes he does not always show up for visits or is late and that upsets her a lot and that she is upset when she has to leave him, also additional stressor is at school.  She reports that she has no friends that she feels unwanted and picked on.  She gets confused easily at school, worries about things, and believes that the teachers become angry with her.  In regards to her mood, mother reported that she is usually happy, unless things do not go her way, and then, she becomes upset and says that nobody cares about her.  She sits in the couch, she become angry, does not speak.  Mother sends her to her room, and she calms down, takes a couple of deep breaths, and that passes.  It is reported that the patient has &quot;always been this way&quot; and that is not a change in her behavior.  Mother did think that she did seem a little more depressed, that she seems more lonely.  Over the last few months, she has seemed a little bit more down because she does not have any friends and that she is bored.  Mother reported that she frequently complains of being bored, but has always been this way.  No sleep disturbance was noted.  No changes in weight.  No suicidal ideation.  No deficits in energy were noted.  Mother did report that she does tend to worry, but her worries tend to be because she gets confused, does not understand what she needs to do, and is quite rigid, but mother did not feel that the worry was actually affecting her functioning on a daily basis.\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  The patient was the 5 pound 12 ounce product of an unplanned pregnancy and normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  She was delivered at 36 weeks gestation.  Mother reported that she received prenatal care.  Difficulties during the pregnancy were denied.  The use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  No eating or sleeping difficulties during the perinatal period were reported.  Temperament was described as easy.  The patient is described as a cuddly baby.  In terms of serious injuries, they were denied.  Serious illnesses:  She has been diagnosed since age 5 with seizures.  Mother was not able to tell me the exact kind of seizures, but it would appear from I could gather that they are focal seizures and possibly simple-to-complex partial seizures.  The patient does not have a history of allergy or toileting problems.  She is currently taking Trileptal 450 mg b.i.d., and she is currently taking Depakote, although she is going to be weaned off the Depakote by her neurologist.  She is taking Prevacid and ibuprofen.  The neurologist that she sees is Dr. Y here at Childrens Hospital.\n\nFAMILY BACKGROUND:  In terms of family background, the patient lives with her mother age 38 and her mothers partner, who is age 40, and with her 16-year-old sister who does not have any developmental delays.  Mother had been married to the patients father, but they were together as a couple beginning 1990, married in 1997, separated in 2002, and divorced in 2003; he lives in the ABC area and visits them every other Saturday, but there are no overnight visits.  The paternal grandparents are both living here in California, but are separated.  They are 3 paternal uncles and 2 paternal aunts.  In terms of the maternal family, maternal grandmother and grandfather are deceased.  Maternal grandfather deceased in 1991 due to cancer.  Maternal grandmother deceased in 2001 due to cancer.  There are 5 maternal aunts and 2 maternal uncles, all who live in California.  She reported that the patient is particularly close to her maternal aunt, whose name is Carmen.  Mothers partner had been married previously; he has 2 children from that relationship, a 23-year-old, and a 20-year-old female, who really are not part of the patients daily life.  In terms of other family background, it was reported that the mothers partner gets frustrated with The patient, does not completely understand the degree of her delay and how that may affect her ability to do things as well as her interpretation of things.  The sister was described as having some resentment towards her older sister, that she feels like she was just to watch out for her, care for her, and that sister has always wanted to follow her around and do the things that she does.  The biological father allegedly was in jail for a year due to drug possession.  Mother reported that he had a problem with methamphetamine.  In addition, she reported there is an accusation that he had molested their niece; however, she stated that there was a trial, and he was found to be not guilty of that.  She stated there was no evidence that he had ever molested the patient or her sister.  There had been quite a bit of chaos in the family when the mother and father were together.  There was a lot of arguing.  There were a lot of moves, there was domestic violence both from father to mother and mother to father consisting mostly of pushing and shoving by mothers report.  The patient did observe this.  After the separation, it was reported that there were continued difficulties that the father took the patient and her sister from school without mothers knowledge and had filed to get custody of them and actually ended up having custody of them for a month, and told the patient and her sister that the mother had abandoned them.  Mother reported that they went to court, and there was a court order giving the mother custody back after the father went to jail.  Mother stated that was approximately 5 years ago.  In terms of current, mother reports that she currently works 2 jobs from 8 to 5 on Monday and Friday and from 6 to 10 on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, but she does have the weekends off.  The patient was reported also to have a job through her school on several weeknights.\n\nOther psychiatric history in the family was denied.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She reported that the patient feels like she does not have any friends, that she is lonely and bored, really does not do much for fun.  Her fun consists primarily of doing crafts with mother, sewing, painting, drawing, beadwork, and things like that.  It was reported that she really feels that she is bored and does not have much to do.\n\nACADEMIC BACKGROUND:  The patient is in the 11th grade at High School.  She has 2 regular education classes, mother could not tell me what they were, but the rest of her classes are special education.  Mother could not tell me what her IQ was, although she noticed she works at about a 4th or 5th grade level.  Mother reported that the terminology most often used with the patient was developmental delay.  Her counselors name is Mr. XYZ, but she reported that overall she is a good student, but she does have sometimes some difficulties at school, becoming upset or angry regarding the little things that she does not seem to understand.  It is reported that the patient feels that she has no friends at school that she is lonely, and that is she does not really care for school.  She reported that the patient is involved in a work program through the school where she works at Pet Extreme on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 8 p.m. where she stocks shelves.  It is reported that she does not like to go to school because she feels like nobody likes her.  She is not involved in any kind of clubs or groups at school.  Mother reported that she is also not receiving CVRC services.\n\nPREVIOUS COUNSELING:  Mother reported that she has been in counseling before, but mother could not give me any information about that, who did the counseling, or what it was about.  She does receive evidently some peer counseling at school because she gets upset and needs help in calming down.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION:  It appears that the patient best qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder, and information from Neurology suggests that the &quot;seizure episodes&quot; are not true seizures, but appear to be pseudoseizures.  The patient is experiencing quite bit of stress with a lot of changes in her life, also difficulty in functioning likely due to her developmental delay makes it difficult for her to understand.\n\nPLAN:  My plan is to meet with the patient in approximately 1 to 2 weeks to complete a clinical interview with her, and then to begin teaching coping skills as well as explore ways for reducing her stress.\n\nDSM IV DIAGNOSES:  \nAXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).\nAXIS II:  Diagnoses deferred.\nAXIS III:  Seizure disorder.\nAXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, peer problems, and educational problems.\nAXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 60.\n'),(15,'1427-Chronic Sinusitis 2','Current','Sample Name: Chronic Sinusitis  Description:  Patient having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nHISTORY:  I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  DynaCirc.\n\nALLERGIES:  Egg-based products cause hives.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \nVITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.\nGENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.\nHEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.\nFACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.\nEYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.\nEARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.\nNOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.\nTHROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.  Both vocal cords move well to midline.\nNECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.\n\nPROCEDURE:  Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.\n\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patients symptoms.\n2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.\n3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.\n4.  Nasal septum deformity.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.  The patient was given instruction on use of nasal saline irrigation to be used twice daily and Clarinex 5 mg daily was recommended.  After the patients ENG examination, we will see the patient back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  In light of the patients atypical dizziness symptoms, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any acute changes or problems with regards to her balance or any other acute changes, which she attributes associated with her dizziness, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room.\n\nThank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your patient.\n'),(16,'1597-Abnormal Echocardiogram 2','NonDrinker','Sample Name: Abnormal Echocardiogram  Description:  Abnormal echocardiogram findings and followup.

Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.\n\nIn this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel &quot;like cramps&quot; and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long.  She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand.  She has also had three spells of &quot;falling&quot;, she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.  Twice it happened, when getting up quickly at night and another time in the grocery store.  She suffered no trauma.  She has no remote history of syncope.  Her weight has not changed in the past year.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Naprosyn, which she takes up to six a day.\n\nALLERGIES:  Sulfa.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or drink.  She is married with two children.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise unremarkable.\n\nPEX:  BP:  130/70 without orthostatic changes.  PR:  72.  WT:  206 pounds.  She is a healthy young woman.  No JVD.  No carotid bruit.  No thyromegaly.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  There is no significant murmur, gallop, or rub.  Chest:  Mildly tender in the upper pectoral areas bilaterally (breast exam was not performed).  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen:  Soft.  Moderately overweight.  Extremities:  No edema and good distal pulses.\n\nEKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal EKG.\n\nECHOCARDIOGRAM (FOR SYNCOPE):  Essentially normal study.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Syncopal spells - These do sound, in fact, to be syncopal.  I suspect it is simple orthostasis/vasovagal, as her EKG and echocardiogram looks good.  I have asked her to drink plenty of fluids and to not to get up suddenly at night.  I think this should take care of the problem.  I would not recommend further workup unless these spells continue, at which time I would recommend a tilt-table study.\n2.  Chest pains - Atypical for cardiac etiology, undoubtedly due to musculoskeletal factors from her emotional stressors.  The Naprosyn is not helping that much, I gave her a prescription for Flexeril and instructed her in its use (not to drive after taking it).\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.  Reassurance that her cardiac checkup looks excellent, which it does.\n2.  Drink plenty of fluids and arise slowly from bed.\n3.  Flexeril 10 mg q 6 p.r.n.\n4.  I have asked her to return should the syncopal spells continue.\n\n\n\n\n'),(18,'186-OB GYN Consultation - 3','Current','Sample Name: OB/GYN Consultation - 3  Description:  Consultation for an ASCUS Pap smear.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nThe patient is a 40-year-old G2, P2, LMP December 06, 2006.  She comes in today in consultation from Dr. A for an ASCUS Pap smear.\n\nPap smear in November 2006 showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.  She has a history of an abnormal Pap smear.  At that time, she was diagnosed with CIN 3 as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.  She underwent a cone biopsy that per her report was negative for any pathology.  She had no vulvar treatment at that time.  Since that time, she has had normal Pap smears.  She denies abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pain.  She uses Yaz for birth control.  She reports one sexual partner since 1994 and she is a nonsmoker.\n\nShe states that she has a tendency to have yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis.  She is also being evaluated for a possible interstitial cystitis because she gets frequent urinary tract infections.  She had a normal mammogram done in August 2006 and a history of perirectal condyloma that have been treated by Dr. B.  She also has a history of chlamydia when she was in college.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HX:  Depression.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HX:  None.\n\nMEDICATIONS:  Lexapro 10 mg a day and Yaz.\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n\nOB HX:  Normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at term in 2001 and 2004, Abc weighed 8 pounds 7 ounces and Xyz weighed 10 pounds 5 ounces.\n\nFAMILY HX:  Maternal grandfather who had a MI which she reports is secondary to tobacco and alcohol use.  He currently has metastatic melanoma, mother with hypertension and depression, father with alcoholism.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a public relations consultant.  She is a nonsmoker, drinks infrequent alcohol and does not use drugs.  She enjoys horseback riding and teaches jumping.\n\nPE:  VITALS: Height: 5 feet 6 inches.  Weight: 139 lb.  BMI: 22.4.  Blood Pressure: 102/58.  GENERAL: She is well-developed and well-nourished with normal habitus and no deformities.  She is alert and oriented to time, place, and person and her mood and affect is normal.  NECK: Without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  BREASTS: Deferred.  ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There is no organomegaly or lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC: Normal external female genitalia.  Vulva, vagina, and urethra, within normal limits.  Cervix is status post cone biopsy; however, the transformation zone grossly appears normal and cervical discharge is clear and normal in appearance.  GC and chlamydia cultures as well as a repeat Pap smear were done.\n\nColposcopy is then performed without and with acetic acid.  This shows an entirely normal transformation zone, so no biopsies are taken.  An endocervical curettage is then performed with Cytobrush and curette and sent to pathology.  Colposcopy of the vulva is then performed again with acetic acid.  There is a thin strip of acetowhite epithelium located transversely on the clitoral hood that is less than a centimeter in diameter.  There are absolutely no abnormal vessels within this area.  The vulvar colposcopy is completely within normal limits.\n\nA/P:  ASCUS Pap smear with history of a cone biopsy in 1993 and normal followup.\n\nWe will check the results of the Pap smear, in addition we have ordered DNA testing for high-risk HPV.  We will check the results of the ECC.  She will return in two weeks for test results.  If these are normal, she will need two normal Pap smears six months apart, and I think followup colposcopy for the vulvar changes.\n'),(19,'1885-Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation - 2','Unknown','\nDescription:  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I.  Stellate ganglion RFTC (radiofrequency thermocoagulation)  left side and interpretation of Radiograph.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I.\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n1.  Stellate ganglion RFTC (radiofrequency thermocoagulation)  left side.\n2.  Interpretation of Radiograph.\n\nANESTHESIA:  IV Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  None.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:  None.\n\nINDICATIONS:  Patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, left side.  Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.\n\nSUMMARY OF PROCEDURE:  Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one fingers breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one fingers breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  \nInterpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.\n\n'),(20,'2537-Foreign Body - Right Nose 2','Unknown','Foreign Body - Right Nose  \nDescription:  Questionable foreign body, right nose.  Belly and back pain.

Belly and back pain.  \n\nSUBJECTIVE:  Mr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.

The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints.  She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis.  She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count.  She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief.  She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms.  Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee.  She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times.  She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain.  She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature.  She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain.  She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking.  She is on significant doses of narcotics.  She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for cancer as above.  She also has a depression.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a chest port placement.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet.  She does not know of what strength up to eight daily.  She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent.

For other review of systems the patient seems stable.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral:  Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female.\nVital Signs:  Height is 5 feet 2 inches.  Weight is 130 pounds.  She is afebrile.\nHEENT:  Benign.\nNeck:  Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurlings.\nChest:  Clear to auscultation.\nHeart:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nAbdomen:  Soft, regular bowel sounds.\nMusculoskeletal:  Examination shows functional range of joint movements.  No focal muscle weakness.  She is deconditioned.\nNeurologic:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  The patient has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.\nSpine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.\n\nFUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION:  Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.\n\nINVESTIGATION:  She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.\n2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.\n3.  Chronic pain syndrome.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patients significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Gs findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.\n'),(24,'492-CT Brain - Hemangioma 3','NonDrinker','Sample Name: CT Brain - Hemangioma  Description:  CT Brain: Midbrain hemangioma\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nCC: Horizontal diplopia.\n\nHX:  This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic.

There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).\n\nNo surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed.

He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.\n\nALLERGIES:  NKDA\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.  Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot.\n\nRADIOGRAPHS:  Of his right ankle today show a preserved joint space.  I dont see any evidence of fracture noted.  Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.\n\nIMPRESSION:  Right Achilles tendon rupture.\n\nPLAN:  I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure. I instructed him not to drink alcohol He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a &frac14;&quot; lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1 lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.  His questions were all answered today.\n\n'),(27,'793-Acne Vulgaris 2','Unknown','Sample Name: Acne Vulgaris  Description:  A simple note on Acne Vulgaris.\n\nACNE VULGARIS, commonly referred to as just acne, is a chronic inflammation of the skin that occurs most often during adolescence but can occur off and on throughout life.  The skin eruptions most often appear on the face, chest, back and upper arms and are more common in males than females.\n\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:\n*  Blackheads the size of a pinhead.\n*  Whiteheads similar to blackheads.\n*  Pustules - lesions filled with pus.\n*  Redness and inflamed skin.\n*  Cysts - large, firm swollen lesions in severe acne.\n*  Abscess - infected lesion that is swollen, tender, inflamed, filled with pus, also seen in severe acne.\n\nCAUSES:\nOil glands in the skin become plugged for reasons unknown but during adolescence, sex-hormone changes play some role.  When oil backs up in the plugged gland, a bacteria normally present on skin causes an infection.  Acne is NOT caused by foods, uncleanliness or masturbation.  Cleaning the skin can decrease its severity but sexual activity has no effect on it.  A family history of acne can indicate if an individual will get acne and how severe it might be.  Currently, acne cant be prevented.\n\nACNE CAN BE BROUGHT ON OR MADE WORSE BY:\n*  Hot or cold temperatures.\n*  Emotional stress.\n*  Oily skin.\n*  Endocrine (hormone) disorder.\n*  Drugs such as cortisones, male hormones, or oral contraceptives.\n*  Some cosmetics.\n*  Food sensitivities.  Again, foods do not cause acne but some certain ones may make it worse.  To discover any food sensitivities, eliminate suspicious foods from your diet and then start eating them again one at a time.  If acne worsens 2-3 days after consumption, then avoid this food.  Acne usually improves in summer so some foods may be tolerated in summer that cant be eaten in winter.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS THAT MAY BE PRESCRIBED TO HELP ACNE INCLUDE:\n*  Oral or topical antibiotics.\n*  Cortisone injections into acne lesions.\n*  Oral contraceptives.\n*  Tretinoin, which may increase sun sensitivity and excessive dryness,  is not recommended during pregnancy.\n*  Accutane (isotretinoin) is a powerful drug to treat acne but causes birth defects.  A woman taking this drug\nmust be on two types of birth control and have negative pregnancy tests.  This drug also increases sun\nsensitivity.  Other more serious side effects can occur and your doctor will discuss those with you if Accutane is to be prescribed.\n\nTETRACYCLINE:\nTetracycline is a very safe antibiotic.  It is not related to penicillin and an allergy to it is unusual.  There are several potential side effects:\n1.  Tetracycline can cause nausea or heartburn.\n2.  Tetracycline can cause vaginitis.\n3.  Tetracycline can cause excessive sun burn.\n\nCAUTIONS ON TETRACYCLINE:\n1.  Do not drink milk or milk products (ice cream, cheese, yogurt, etc.).  This will cancel out the Tetracycline.  Separate the Tetracycline from these products by one and one-half hours before and after each capsule.  Do have a small amount of non milk-containing food in your stomach first to prevent nausea.\n2.  Do not take Tetracycline if you are pregnant.\n3.  Do not take Tetracycline if you are taking birth control pills unless specifically instructed to do so.\n4.  If at the beach or skiing in the sun, use an effective sunblock (SPF-15 or greater) to prevent burning.\n\nTREATMENT:\n*  Most cases of acne respond well to treatment and will likely disappear once adolescence is over.  Even with adequate treatment, acne will tend to flare up from time to time and sometimes permanent facial scars or pitting of the skin may occur.\n*  If your skin is oily, gently clean face with a fresh, clean wash cloth using unscented soap for 3- 5 minutes; an antibacterial soap may work better.  A previously used wet washcloth will harbor bacteria.  Dont aggressively scrub tender lesions as this may spread infection; be gentle.  Rinse the soap off for a good 1-2 minutes.  Dry face carefully with a clean towel and use an astringent such as rubbing alcohol that will remove the skin oil.\n\nOTHER TIPS THAT MAY HELP ACNE:\n*  Shampoo hair at least twice a week.  Keep hair off of face even while sleeping as hair can spread oil and bacteria.  If you have dandruff, use a dandruff shampoo.  Avoid cream hair rinses.\n*  Wash sweat and skin oil off as soon as possible after sweating and exercising.\n*  Use thinner, water-based cosmetics instead of the heavier oil-based ones.\n*  Avoid skin moisturizers unless recommended by your doctor.\n*  Do not squeeze, pick, rub or scratch your skin or the acne lesions.  This may damage the skin causing scarring and delay healing of acne.  Only a doctor should remove blackheads.\n*  Keep from resting face on hands while reading, studying or watching TV.\n*  Try to avoid pressing the phone receiver on you chin while talking on the phone.\n*  Ultraviolet light may be a treatment recommended by your doctor but this is by no means a license to sunbathe!  Dont use the sun to treat acne.\n*  Dermabrasion may be another option to treat acne scars.  This is a type of cosmetic surgery to help remove unsightly scars.\n\n'),(28,'97-Psych Consult - Altered Mental Status','NonDrinker','Sample Name: Psych Consult - Altered Mental Status  Description:  Psychiatric Consultation of patient with altered mental status.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nREASON FOR CONSULT:  Altered mental status.\n\nHPI:  The patient is 77-year-old Caucasian man with benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post cardiac transplant 10 years ago who was admitted to the Physical Medicine and Rehab Service for inpatient rehab after suffering a right cerebellar infarct last month.  Last night, he became confused and he eloped from the unit.  When he was found, he became combative.  This a.m., he continued to be aggressive and required administration of four-point soft restraints in addition to Haldol 1 mg intramuscularly.  There was also documentation of him having paranoid thoughts that his wife was going out spending his money instead of being with him in the hospital.  Given this presentation, Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate and offer management recommendations.\n\nThe patient states that he does remember leaving the unit looking for his wife, but does not recall becoming combative, needing restrains and emergency medications.  He reports feeling fine currently, denying any complaints.  The patients wife notes that her husband might be confused and disoriented due to being in the hospital environment.  She admits that he has some difficulty with memory for sometime and becomes irritable when she is not around.  However, he has never become as combative as he has this particular episode.\n\nHe negates any symptoms of depression or anxiety.  He also denies any hallucinations or delusions.  He endorses problems with insomnia.  At home, he takes temazepam.  His wife and son note that the temazepam makes him groggy and disoriented at times when he is at home.\n\nPAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  He denies any prior psychiatric treatment or intervention.

He denies any history of alcohol or substance abuse.\n\nMENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:  He is an average-sized white male, casually dressed, with wife and son at bedside.  He is pleasant and cooperative with good eye contact.  He presents with paucity of speech content; however, with regular rate and rhythm.  He is tremulous which is worse with posturing also some increased motor tone noted.  There is no evidence of psychomotor agitation or retardation.  His mood is euthymic and supple and reactive, appropriate to content with reactive affect appropriate to content.  His thoughts are circumstantial but logical.  He defers most of his responses to his wife.  There is no evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideations.  No presence of paranoid or bizarre delusions.  He denies any perceptual abnormalities and does not appear to be responding to internal stimuli.  His attention is fair and his concentration impaired.  He is oriented x3 and his insight is fair.  On mini-mental status examination, he has scored 22 out of 30.  He lost 1 for time, lost 1 for immediate recall, lost 2 for delayed recall, lost 4 for reverse spelling and could not do serial 7s.  On category fluency, he was able to name 17 animals in one minute.  He was unable to draw clock showing 2 minutes after 10.  His judgment seems limited.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8, phosphorous 3, pre-albumin 27, PTT 24.8, PT 14.1, INR 1, white blood cell count 8.01, hemoglobin 11.5, hematocrit 35.2, and platelet count 255,000.  Urinalysis on January 21, 2007, showed trace protein, trace glucose, trace blood, and small leukocyte esterase.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC DATA:  MRI of brain with and without contrast done on January 21, 2007, showed hemorrhagic lesion in right cerebellar hemisphere with diffuse volume loss and chronic ischemic changes.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nAXIS I:\n1.  Delirium resulting due to general medical condition versus benzodiazepine \nintoxication/withdrawal.\n2.  Cognitive disorder, not otherwise specified, would rule out vascular dementia.\n3.

Encouraged liberal family visitation and frequent verbal redirection by nursing staff to help keep patient oriented.\n2.  We would discontinue temazepam and refrain from using other benzodiazepines in this elderly patient as it may cause paradoxical confusion.\n3.  We changed Seroquel to 12.5 mg p.o. at noon, 25 mg p.o. at 5 p.m., and 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. as confusion seems to be more prominent at night time and would not want to impair his ability to function in therapy during the daytime.\n4.  For breakthrough agitation, we recommend Zyprexa Zydis 5 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. for severe agitation.\n5.  Above case and recommendations discussed with Dr. Ranjit Chacko.\n6.
